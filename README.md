# A-Beginner-Guide-To-LaTeX-Resources

Welcome.

The kernel of the project is the file called `Guide.pdf' in this repository.

The files inside of folders are supporting material for the guide. Some of these are referenced throughout the guide, while others are auxiliary projects that will accompany the guide.

This project is in a draft state and is being updated frequently.
