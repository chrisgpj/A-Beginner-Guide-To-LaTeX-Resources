# Welcome to the LaTex Intro by Chris

I have made a repository to help structure my own progression in LaTex: for too long I have cobbled together a poor understanding of the program! And hey, why not share it with others?

The content of this repository is not trying to reinvent the wheel: trying to do that could only cause damage. Instead, this repository aims to be a supplement and guide for learning LaTeX from a variety of top-notch sources.

This 'Read Me' file is the navigation centre for the repository: it does not contain much information itself, aside from that needed to help you find what you need. I would put all the info into one document, if it weren't for example files being incredibly important. Also, having this repository setup means that I can change things in more modular way.

There is not much more to say here, so it is time to dive in. Below you will find a list of contents of the repository in _approximate_ order of recommended reading. I have set it up so each folder is like a module on a topic. Yet further below, you will find an index to the repository.
