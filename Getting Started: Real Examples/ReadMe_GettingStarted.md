# Guide to 'Getting Started: Real Examples'

It is often said that a common mistake people make when starting on LaTeX is focusing too much on formatting and not enough on content (i.e. they ought to get on with what they are writing). This is a cryptic thing to say. One can't help but spend time on formatting if there is a fatal error in their LaTeX markup that is preventing typesetting. Furthermore, if formatting sucks, then people may not choose to use LaTeX at all. And finally, maybe the reason people spend too much time on formatting is because the program is either too cumbersome, or not well-understood and explained by the community. I believe that promoters of LaTeX should be careful when making pronouncements like that; they should provide useful insights on workflow, instead.

Despite my critique, I actually do agree that it is important to focus on writing first. I use LaTeX now becuase I put it to practical use early on. By being content focused, I have now, over time, become more comfortable with a program that I initially thought was well-beyond my reckoning (more importantly, I thought that this sort of thing was not possible for someone with my personality).

I want to provide some examples of putting LaTeX to use even when I knew very little about it. I hope that these exmples can be adapted by others for early-use of LaTeX.
