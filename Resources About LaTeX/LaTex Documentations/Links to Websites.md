# Links to Websites and Online Documentations

# Online Tutorials lp and Community Forums

Note: Most things are available online now, but what I mean by 'online' is that the thing is online in character. A good example is the W3schools tutorials, which are quite interactive; another is the vast swathe of less structured help one can find on forums. In contrast, a PDF like the memoir documentation can be found on the web and viewed digitally, but it is really just a piece of structured text, as we often see in print.

I have drawn a somewhat arbitrary line and put stable texts in the documentation pile, and websites in the online help pile. See below sections for more detail.





## A Few Concerns About Online Help 
I'm of the view that LaTeX has been around long enough for things to get messy. Some features of LaTeX are no longer supported, by which I mean there are packages which are not being updated and are starting to not work with other packages. Furthermore, people are using LaTeX in different ways: different machines and operating systems, different approaches to off-line and on-line work, different approaches to fonts and so on. This is all well and good until a 'solution' makes an assumption about what you are doing. Good solutions are those which are always true, or have their realm of truth well-framed, even if that means they are a little less user-friendly. If you look at the popular forum _Stack Exchange_, the best answers are those which are both explicit and robust, not necessarily those which are short; and they are rarely the sort of answers that begin with "Just use [...]", for those answers are often making assumption that instantly breaks down - often this is the very reason the problem was posted. The whole mode of online help struggles with always having to assume a certain amount about someone's knowledge or experience.
 
The above reasons are why I feel compelled to separate websites from documentations. A good documentation is worth its (figurative) weight in gold; even if you don't read documentations front-to-back, you still want them on-hand. Websites are often good but a generic 'got to this forum' means you have to sift through a lot of bullshit. Furthermore, many websites often cited as helpful assume that you have read official documentations - despite not providing clear references or pathways to finding said documentations. 

So, my approach is to curate online help and record useful things here - see the below section titled 'Online Help Links'

For documentations, I have taken the approach of downloading these and providing them in the folders of this repository. But it is also important a pathway to where these were found - see the below section titled 'Links to Documentations'.

Finally, a formal guide to 'official' LaTeX help online is given, and this is something that you might want to skip down to read sooner rather than later - see the section titled 'Official Help'.

## Online Help

### The LaTeX Project

This is also an base for LaTex. It is the official website of LaTeX in that it is the website of the project responsible for maintaining the entiity of LaTeX.

https://www.latex-project.org/

However, the project funds are actually administered by the Tex Users Group.

### Tex User Group

https://www.tug.org/

This more informal looking website is — I understand —, the most official base for LaTeX and TeX that there is online. 

The Tex Users Group is the administrator of the LaTeX Project.

### The Comprehensive Tex Archive Network

https://www.ctan.org

Example of things you would go to this site for are fonts catlogues, documentation downloads, and information and mirrors for packages. It functions as a kind of repository for the TeX Users Group.

e.g.
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/texbytopic

### A side note on Documentation state

---

[IMPORTANT: The below statements are nullified. Leslie Lamport wrote a manual but it is strangely very rarely referenced - possibly it is not written in an accessble way, or the book itself is not very accessible?!]

---

It will be noticed by navigating this page that LaTeX is not obviously documented. I am surprised at this, but it does appear to be the case (although I am now reading through an auxillary documentation that _must_ refer to the core docuementation, to check). The lack of documentation explains much of the disarray of the community help.

I am not the only person to raise this. A question was posted on Stack Exchange and did not yield an answer: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/47958/where-can-i-find-the-standard-latex-reference-manual

But this thread highlights the ambiguity in a more positive way: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/66/which-manuals-are-on-your-tex-reference-shelf. I am pleased to say that the original poster mentioned the documentation for the memoir package. Upon discovering the memoir documentation, I found the quality so high that I adopted it as the official reference in my own mind.
