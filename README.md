# A-Beginner-Guide-To-LaTeX-Resources

Welcome.

An introduction to the project, and the recommended first steps, and all other necessary information will be gained within a few minutes of starting to read the guide, which is the file called `Guide.pdf' in this repository.

The other files outside of folders are the TeX and auxiliary files for producing the guide pdf â€” you do not need to worry about those from a reader's point of view.

The files inside of folders are supporting material for the guide. These are referenced as you read through the guide.
