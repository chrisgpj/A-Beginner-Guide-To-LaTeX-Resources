# A-Beginner-Guide-To-LaTeX-Resources

Welcome.

The kernel of the projects is in the file called `Guide.pdf' in this repository.

The files inside of folders are supporting material for the guide. Some of these are referenced throughout the guide, while others are auxiliary projects that will accompany the guide.

This project is in a draft state and is being updated frequently.

The guide originally ran to over 30 pages. The missing content included demonstrations of particular LaTeX capabilities, discussion about setting up workflow, and some discussion about coding-habits. Most of this content was unnecessary, but anything that remains of interest will be added to the other folders in this repository.
